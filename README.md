# Heart Attack Predictor

## Introduction
I have created a Heart Attack Predictor utilizing Python's machine learning capabilities. The purpose of this project is to predict the likelihood of a heart attack occurrence by tracking key indicators in heart health assessment. I utilize features such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain, and other biometric measurements to achieve this goal.

## Project Overview
This project showcases my skills in machine learning and programming. I conducted detailed data preprocessing relative to my dataset to ensure efficiency and optimal model performance. Utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) model testing on the processed subsets, I demonstrate proficiency in data handling and the implementation of machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Motivation
This project represents a culmination of my interest in Biotechnology and my commitment to leveraging technology for proactive healthcare solutions. However, it's essential to acknowledge the bias present in the healthcare system. As my project primarily focuses on male-dominated data, it may provide a more accurate assessment for men than women. Addressing such biases is crucial for creating inclusive and equitable healthcare solutions.
